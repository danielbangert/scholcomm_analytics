Welcome to our Blog! Here, you'll find insights from our work as Data Analysts in the domain of scholarly communication. Particularly, we like to share rapid case-studies showing how we support data-driven workflows and decision-making around scholarly communication with R.

We are based at the [Göttingen State and University Library](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/news/), one of the largest academic libraries in Germany. We are using R-based tools in our everyday work and contribute to R package developements and training activities. In this blog, you'll find news and case-studies around:

- Open Access and Open Science Analytics
- R Packages making use of open databases and helping us in our work
- R Tools for interactive visualisations and dashboard developements
- R-related training and outreach activities 

We want to thank [Maëlle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/) for encouraging us to start a blog about our work. We are using [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), a new web publishing format optimized for scientific and technical writing.
