description: |
  Based at the GÃ¶ttingen State and University Library, 
  we are analysing data around scholarly communication using open data and tools.
  Here, you'll find insights, and examples of our work using R. Particularly, we like
  to publish rapid case-studies showing how to support data-driven workflows and 
  decision-making around scholarly communication in libraries using R.
